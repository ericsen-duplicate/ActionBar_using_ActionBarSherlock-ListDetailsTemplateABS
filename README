Switching to ActionBarSherlock
================================================================================
This week I was having problems getting TabNavigation on pre-3.0 devices to work
using the android-14 ActionBarCompat library. Decided to give ActionBarSherlock 
a try and glad that I did. From now on I will be using ActionBarSherlock instead
of ActionBarCompat because:
	1) Download and setup create an ActionBarSherlock Library which is easy to
		incorporate into a new Android project. The way I was using ActionBar-
		Compat was to add all  the individual folders and files as in the 
		sample. Here's a good YouTube setup video:

	2) ActionBarSherlock comes with TabNav code where ActionBarCompat does not.
	3) ActionBarSherlock so far is very reliable and has good support.
	4) Lots of samples with download:

ActionBar Project

Demonstrates the 3 major ActionBar modes:
	1) Tab
	2) List
	3) Standard
Each mode sample is a separate SherlockFragmentActivity.
All 3 modes have 3 options. Each option start a different SherlockFragment.	
Each mode sample's app icon acts as a Home button to return the sample back to
its starting point.
